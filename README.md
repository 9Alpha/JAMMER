Final Project 2015

Not much to see here really.
If you're in the know, you already know what's up.
If you're not, why read me?



Currently Final_Project_Tests_Mk2.pde and TrellisTest_Modded.ino are the only ones needed to run the project.
Upload TrellisTest to the arduino connected to the Trellis board. In Final_Tests, the Trellis board should be
set to the Serial port and the other arduino to the Arduino port.
