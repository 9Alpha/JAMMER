Final Project 2015

Not much to see here really.
If you're in the know, you already know what's up.
If you're not, why read me?



Currently the Final_Project_Tests_Mk2 folder and TrellisTest_Modded.ino are the only ones needed to run the project. Upload TrellisTest to the arduino connected to the Trellis board. Run Final_Tests with processing. In Final_Tests, the Trellis board should be set to the Serial port and the other arduino to the Arduino port.



Check the Wiki if you have any questions.
